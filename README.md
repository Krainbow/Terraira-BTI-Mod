# TModMaker by SpaghettiLord1010

## Made by SpaghettiLord1010 - application to create simple Terraria mods very quickly. (TModLoader needs to be installed!)

This program aims to help you create mods very fast, first you will need to create a skeletton for your mod on this site:
> http://javid.ddns.net/tModLoader/generator/ModSkeletonGenerator.html

Upon opening the executable you see a button for selecting the work directory - this is the directory where the files build.txt and so on are positioned.
Now you can easily edit and fill out all the needed fields.
When you are finished filling out the information you need to refresh and check if all is correct - if this is the case you can click the button to create your modfile.
You do not need to worry about where to put something or whatever, the files you need are positioned correctly and everything should be working fine.

You will now need to move the entire Mod-Folder into this directory:
> C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\Mod Sources

The folder might not exist yet, if that is the case, simply create it.
Now you can open up TerrariaModLoader and you will note a new menu point: "Mod Sources" click there and in this folder there should be your mod! Click on the button: Build and Refresh and your mod should be good to go!

I hope you have a fun time creating mods with this application, maybe I will work on it further to add town-NPCs or enemies but for now, a item-creator is better than nothing.
There might be some little mistakes sometimes, but overall it was tested very well - it should work well!
